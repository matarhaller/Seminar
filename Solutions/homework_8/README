The solutions to the PySci Fall 2012 homework on parallelism
are contained in the file homework8solutions.py

Simply run the script from the command line:
$ python homework8solutions.py


NOTES:
The default set of trials takes a few minutes to run on my laptop
( MacBook Air, four cores at 2GHz each )

To speed up (or slow down) the simulations, modify either of these variables:
n_runs
  - the integer number of times to run each trial
  - a lower number will reduce the accuracy of the execution time estimates
darts_thrown
  - the list of n_darts to throw for each trial
  - i.e. to run more quickly set:
    darts_thrown = map(int, np.logspace(1, 6, 10))
