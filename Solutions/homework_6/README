Homework 6, Python for Science Fall 2012.

This solution is implemented in two files, populate_db.py and homework6solutions.py
They must be run in that order!


To scrape info from the web into a local database, run
$ python populate_db.py

Then, to run the simulations and create the plots, run
$ python homework6solutions.py


To explore how guaranteeing a win for various probability thresholds affects
the outcome, alter the `cut` parameter in the `simulation` function in homework6solutions.py
NOTE: to re-run simulations, you may need to drop the `simulation` table from the database.
to do this, run the following SQL command (either from the command line or from within python)
>> DROP TABLE simulation;
