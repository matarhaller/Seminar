Homework 8 Solutions

To run the image search & modification GUI, simply run:
$ python homework8solutions.py


COMMENTS:
These solutions use Traits and TraitsUI to implement an image search & modification
program, using the MPL_FigureEditor class introduced in lecture.
We introduce a few modules we haven't seen in the class yet; hopefully this is
more informative than confusing!

New modules:
 - simplejson, a JSON-parser.  (JSON is a format commonly used in online transactions, like
   the google image search API. See http://json.org/ for more info.)
   This is an alternative to BeautifulSoup, which is built to handle HTML, while simplejson
   is designed to (of course) handle JSON.
 - Image, ImageFilter, and ImageEnhance are all part of the Python Image Library, a set of 
   tools which (of course) are built to interact with images within Python.  Read more about
   it at http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/index.htm.
   This is an alternative to modules like scikits-image (which has a more of a focus on 
   image analysis, while PIL focusses more on image manipulation).
