The homework 4 solutions are contained in three programs,
> xmlrpc_client.py
> xmlrpc_server.py
> audio_analysis.py

To run the client/server pair, open two terminals, start the server
running in one, and run the client in the other.  (Make sure cake.jpg is present.)

term1$ python xmlrpc_server.py
term2$ python xmlrpc_client.py

The audio analysis code uses `smoothing.py` and `notes_list.txt` as supporting
files, so they must be in the local directory. To run the audio analysis, 
make sure those files nd the `homework4_data` folder are present,
then run 
$ python audio_analysis.py
