The official solutions are contained in three python files, and 
will run on the folder 'verification_images'
Read the source documentation for further explanation.

DOWNLOAD TRAINING IMAGES FROM
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~ishivvers/data/50_categories.tar.gz
AND VALIDATION IMAGES FROM
http://astro.berkeley.edu/~ishivvers/data/validation_images.tar.gz

NOTE:
This problem requires a lot of memory, computation, and hard disk space!
The below commands will probably take a few hundreds of seconds to run 
and will produce a file about 5GB in size.
If you don't have the resources for this, don't run it!

REQUIRES:
python modules:
- pylab, scipy, sklearn, skimage, multiprocessing


TO RUN SOLUTIONS:
in folder that contains both `50_categories` and `validation_images` folders, run
$ python feature_calc.py
$ python train_classifier.py
$ python homework5solutions.py
