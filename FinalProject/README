This code will implement some initial preprocessing steps for raw ECoG data.
description of contents:

subj_globals.py - defines the Subject class and associated methods (including plotting)

ST26.py - either creates or loads the an instantiation of the Subject class with parameters relevant to subject ST26. Calls on subj_globals.py

visualize_brain.py - calls on ST26.py to plot activity on cortex with electrodes 

You will need to edit pathtodata in ST26.py to match where your data is.
Also in ST26.py edit DTdir to match where you want the analyses to go.

from the command line run:
python setup.py build_ext -i
python visualize_brain.py

clicking on an electrode will plot a figure showing its mean raw data trace across trials.

A log of all preprocessing steps is kept in the data folder.

future steps:
- implement analytic_amp methods in cython
- make analytic amplitude use fftw
- implement option for plotting traces by conditions
- implement single trial images
- make it so can load arbitrary subject without changing imported module in visual_brain.py (make it an argument to the function) use arg parse to give it from the command line
