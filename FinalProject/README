This code will implement some initial preprocessing steps for raw ECoG data.
description of contents:

subj_globals.py - defines the Subject class and associated methods (including plotting)

ST26.py - either creates or loads the an instantiation of the Subject class with parameters relevant to subject ST26. Calls on subj_globals.py

visualize_brain.py - calls on ST26.py to plot activity on cortex with electrodes 

from the command line run:
python setup.py build_ext -i
python visualize_brain.py

You will need to edit pathtodata in ST26.py to match where your data is.
Also in ST26.py edit DTdir to match where you want the analyses to go.

clicking on an electrode will plot a figure showing its mean activity across trials

future steps:
- implement create_CAR and analytic_amp methods in cython (make them faster)
- make analytic amplitude use fftw (faster) - and then it will be usable
- implement option for plotting traces by conditions
- implement single trial images
- make it so can load arbitrary subject without changing imported module in visual_brain.py (make it an argument to the function) use arg parse to give it from the command line
