HW6 - databasing hw
was able to easily write sqlite commands and create tables, but had trouble interacting with the tables through python
i think that the way that i accessed the information on from intrade was a huge hack - there must be a better way to get the contract ids and associated information
the parts that i did of this assignment were definitely more beautifulsoup heavy than squlite.
you'll have to change the database directory to make it work.
