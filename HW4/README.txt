HW4 has 3 files - 
HW4_client.py and HW4_server.py are for q1
	note that HW4_client should be run from within the HW4/ directory becuase it references a file that is in the HW2 directory (../HW2/) and I didn't give the full path.

HW4.py is for q2
*should* be able to run it from the command line with the filename and whether or not to plot
run HW4.py -s "1.aif", -i 1

I was having problems with the file locations, so I just moved 1 file into the HW4 directory as an example. (for some reason giving the full path to the music file didn't work for me)

this doesn't account for harmonics, so it only provides the frequency with the maximum power
