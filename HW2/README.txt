This is an updated version of HW2 without giant data files in the data folder. I had to make a new branch because I was unable to push to github from master.

HW2/data contains my data (for q1)

To run hw:
run HW2_v1.py
answer_hw()


Problems =
I am unable to resize my figure (so you'll need to stretch it out to see the brain and the traces side by side). I still need to remove the tick marks from the brain axes.

Didn't get to brushing â€¦
