This is an updated version of HW2 without giant data files in the data folder. I had to make a new branch because I was unable to push to github from master.
I'm not able to push the master branch to github because of two largish data files that I put there, added (didn't commit). It's no longer tracking them, but maybe because of the change, pushing ends up timing out.

HW2/data contains my data (for q1)

To run hw:
run HW2_v1.py
answer_hw()

The figure I made a combination of two figures - my original ones that I used previously are separate - one brain image and one traces image (the pngs in the HW2/data folder).

Problems =
I am unable to resize my figure (so you'll need to stretch it out to see the brain and the traces side by side). I still need to remove the tick marks from the brain axes.

Didn't get to brushing â€¦
